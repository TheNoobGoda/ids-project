1. Business understanding
    - Give your view of the business problem following the CRISP-DM list of outputs when adequate.
2. Data Understanding
    - Looking at the raw data, describe variables according to their types: interval-scaled, binary, nominal, ordinal, ratio-scaled. Be aware that there are specific methods suitable to each type of variable.
    - Perform a preliminary analysis (summaries, spread measures, histograms, boxplots, density). These are interesting to be applied to the raw data to “uncover’ ’ inconsistencies, outliers, duplicates etc.
    - Perform bivariate analysis (correlations, regression)
    - Provide any insights about the data and the problem that you may have found.
3. Data Preparation
    - List of main changes that can need to be performed to the raw data, including feature selection.
    - Describe the potentially useful ones and their results in terms of data.
4. Modeling: consider the balanced and the non-balanced versions of the dataset as 2 separate problems. First work with the balanced data and then with the non-balanced data. Try each of the methods below, select hyper parameters using default values and empirical analysis. Separate a test set and usecross-validation on the rest of the examples. Visualize models when possible, visualize results, produce aggregating tables with good insightful summaries of the results, and whatever other tools you may find useful.
    - Nearest neighbor
    - Bayesian Classifier
    - Decision Trees
    - Tree ensembles
    - Support Vector Machines
    - Neural Network Classifier
    - Comparison
5. Evaluation and Main Conclusions
    - What is the best model and the recommended data science procedure for the business?
    - What do you think that the business can gain from your data science effort?
    - What are the lessons learnt?
    - What is your summary of the achieved results?
